    I moved to Colima and graduated in Software Engineering. After that, I moved to Guadalajara and started working
    as a Web Developer in front-end. I've learned and began mastering such technologies for two and a half years now.
    At the same time, I got <span class="bold">certified in Java 8</span> to expand my knowledge and open new roads in the future.
